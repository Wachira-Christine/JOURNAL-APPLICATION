## PEER TO PEER SERVICE
### Project overview
Student Peer-to-Peer Service Marketplace, a platform where students can offer and request goods and services (such as tutoring, selling notes, and graphic design). The system will feature login/registration, chat, ratings & reviews, and secure payment integration. It is designed not only to promote collaboration and resource sharing but also to give students the opportunity to earn money from their skills and services.
